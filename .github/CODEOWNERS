# CODEOWNERS â€” backend-only repo
#
# This repository is backend-only and maintained by a single user.
# Replace `@Analyst-Ninja` below with your actual GitHub username if different.
# Format: <pattern> <owner> [owner...]
#
# All files in the repository are owned by the single user below.
*    @Analyst-Ninja

# If you later add more owners or teams, list them separated by spaces on the same line:
#   src/ @username @other-user

# Notes:
# - Owners must be valid GitHub usernames (e.g. @your-username).
# - To require code owner approvals, enable "Require review from Code Owners"
#   in the branch protection rule for your protected branch (e.g. `main`).
